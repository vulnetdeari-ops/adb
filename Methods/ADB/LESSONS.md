# ADB Lessons

Append-only record of defects in the method itself, found by real projects (P61A).

This file is not an issue tracker. Project problems belong in that project's `adb/08-OPEN-ISSUES.md`. Only findings whose root cause is ADB itself belong here.

Nothing here changes the method until the user adopts it. STATUS says whether that happened.

## L-001 — Setup never enforced the issue-register location

DATE: 2026-08-26
PROJECT: buchhaltung-web
SYMPTOM: The project kept its issue register at the repository root as `OPEN-ISSUES.md`, declared that file canonical inside the file itself, and also carried an `## Open issues` section in `adb/07-STATUS.md`. `adb/08-OPEN-ISSUES.md` did not exist although the Source of Truth was not collapsed. Three candidate locations, and the STATUS section claimed `0` open issues while real unresolved conflicts existed.
ROOT CAUSE: P15 forbids alternate filenames and P23 names the register, but nothing in the method verifies the register's location once a project is running. The inherited `AGENTS.md` already routed ADB projects to `adb/08-OPEN-ISSUES.md`, so the method and its own rules file disagreed in practice with no point responsible for noticing. Method silent where the project needed a rule.
PROPOSED CHANGE: Give the status review an explicit Source-of-Truth layout check: the numbered files present, no ADB content living under non-ADB filenames, no topic duplicated between a numbered file and an ad-hoc one.
STATUS: ADOPTED — added as Step 2A of `/adb-status`, 2026-08-26.

## L-002 — No terminating condition for open issues

DATE: 2026-08-26
PROJECT: buchhaltung-web
SYMPTOM: The product could sit indefinitely in "almost complete". P61 correctly refused to call it complete, but nothing forced any open issue toward an exit, so a status review could run any number of times and produce the same verdict with no progress.
ROOT CAUSE: P50 defines what blocks release and P61 defines what completion means, but neither bounds how long an issue may stay OPEN. A gate that can be re-failed forever is a report, not a gate.
PROPOSED CHANGE: Count how many reviews each issue survives and force an exit — FIX, ACCEPT or REJECT — at a fixed count.
STATUS: ADOPTED — added as P50A ISSUE CONVERGENCE and the `CARRIED` field in P25, 2026-08-26.

---

## L-003 — Project copies of the method have no age

DATE: 2026-08-26
PROJECT: buchhaltung-web
SYMPTOM: The project's `ADB.md` was modified but uncommitted. Its working copy was byte-identical to the canonical `SKILL.md`, so the committed version was some older method revision — but which one, and how old, was not answerable from the repository.
ROOT CAUSE: Setup copies the method into the project and the copy carries no provenance. A copy with no version is unfalsifiable.
PROPOSED CHANGE: Stamp the copy with the canonical repository's short git sha and date on its first line.
STATUS: ADOPTED — added as P1A METHOD VERSION, 2026-08-26.

---

## L-004 — P1A collided with the frontmatter it was written for

DATE: 2026-08-26
PROJECT: buchhaltung-web
SYMPTOM: P1A demanded the `METHOD-VERSION` stamp on the first line of the project `ADB.md`. The canonical `SKILL.md` opens with a YAML frontmatter block, and the project copy keeps it. Following P1A literally would have pushed `---` to line 3 and broken the block for any harness that parses it.
ROOT CAUSE: The point was written without checking the file it governs. A rule about a copy must hold for the actual shape of that copy.
PROPOSED CHANGE: Allow the stamp as the first line after the frontmatter block, and forbid placing it above frontmatter.
STATUS: ADOPTED — P1A reworded 2026-08-26, same day it was introduced.

---

## L-005 — Slash commands were installed into the user home

DATE: 2026-08-26
PROJECT: ADB method repo
SYMPTOM: `/adb-define` and the other four commands appeared in every Cursor, Codex and Claude session, including projects without `METHOD: ADB`.
ROOT CAUSE: `install-commands.sh` targeted `$HOME/.cursor/commands`, `$HOME/.codex/prompts` and `$HOME/.claude/commands`. P1 forbids ADB from affecting ordinary work in unrelated projects. A home-level command list is exactly that.
PROPOSED CHANGE: Install into the project's own harness directories. Remove leftover home-level links. State the rule in P1.
STATUS: ADOPTED — installer is project-scoped; P1 forbids home-level installs; `--remove-global` cleans leftovers, 2026-08-26.

---

## L-006 — Project helpers copied ADB.md without stamp, commands, or adb/08

DATE: 2026-08-26
PROJECT: ADB method + Shared/Scripts
SYMPTOM: Project helpers wrote `METHOD.md` and a bare `ADB.md`, but left no `METHOD-VERSION` stamp, installed no project-local slash commands, and still created a root `OPEN-ISSUES.md` that contradicts the issue-register rule.
ROOT CAUSE: Setup lived outside the method. The method gained a version stamp, project-scoped commands and the numbered issue register; the helpers were never updated.
PROPOSED CHANGE: One `setup-into-project.sh` that stamps and installs commands into the project. Do not auto-create Vision/Spec — that is DEFINE.
STATUS: ADOPTED — 2026-08-26.

---

## L-007 — Chip labels vs A/B/C Decision Questions

DATE: 2026-08-26/27
PROJECT: ADB method
SYMPTOM: Draft decision UI used Perplexity-style chip labels. Agents and drafts drifted toward long label text instead of single-letter answers. That conflicted with global `AGENTS.md` Decision Questions (A/B/C + „Entscheide du“).
ROOT CAUSE: A feature sketch taught a discarded interaction. The method and the reading copy already followed A/B/C; the feature note still named “chips” and looked like an open path.
PROPOSED CHANGE: Keep A/B/C + „Entscheide du“ as the only rule. Mark chips rejected. Rename the feature note so the filename does not teach chips.
STATUS: SUPERSEDED — 2026-09-01 by L-019: owner wants chips; keep labels short. Long Perplexity-style chip sentences stay forbidden.

---

## L-008 — Project copy of the method was a second source

DATE: 2026-08-28
PROJECT: ADB method
SYMPTOM: Setup copied `SKILL.md` into every project as `ADB.md`, then needed a version stamp, a STALE check, and slash commands that restated the method so they would not cite a stale copy. Agents had two method files. P60 was cited though it had no own section.
ROOT CAUSE: A copy ages. Machinery to keep the copy honest became larger than the method. Commands restated `SKILL.md` instead of pointing at it.
PROPOSED CHANGE: Do not copy the method into the project. `METHOD.md` is the switch. Agents read canonical `SKILL.md`. Commands stay short. Leftover `ADB.md` is ignored; `--refresh` removes it. Drop the P60 citation.
STATUS: ADOPTED — 2026-08-28.

---

## L-009 — Rulebook should state who sets the destination

DATE: 2026-08-28
PROJECT: ADB method
SYMPTOM: The method explained phases and files. It did not say in one place: the owner sets where the product must land; the agent writes that down, builds in slices that fit context, and proves it (browser, tests, logins).
ROOT CAUSE: The method was written as numbered process. The reason it exists is a non-programmer owner.
PROPOSED CHANGE: Open `SKILL.md` with that job. DEFINE / BUILD / COMPLETION in plain language. Commands point at those sections, not at old point numbers.
STATUS: ADOPTED — 2026-08-28.

---

## L-010 — Naming another product method kept it in play

DATE: 2026-08-31
PROJECT: ADB method
SYMPTOM: Agents treated a name in the files as a peer method and followed leftover folders and commands.
ROOT CAUSE: The method was defined against that name. Naming it taught agents it still exists.
PROPOSED CHANGE: Write only this method. Setup writes `METHOD: PLAIN` or `METHOD: ADB`. Existing product docs stay as brownfield evidence for DEFINE.
STATUS: ADOPTED — 2026-08-31.

---

## L-011 — A dropped chat UI and Lead were still in the method after they were gone

DATE: 2026-08-31
PROJECT: ADB method
SYMPTOM: The method still named a retired chat UI (decision chips, upstream issue) and treated Lead as an orchestra role for the READINESS key. That UI is gone.
ROOT CAUSE: Those names were leftover. After they were dropped, the files still taught agents to wait for that UI or a missing orchestra Lead.
PROPOSED CHANGE: Remove the retired UI name. Decision rule stays A/B/C + decide-for-me. Review writes READINESS. Briefs are executable without a worker role.
STATUS: ADOPTED — 2026-08-31.

---

## L-012 — ADB without Lead contradicted factory AGENTS.md

DATE: 2026-08-31
PROJECT: ADB method
SYMPTOM: After L-011, ADB told the reading agent to implement, prove, and commit only if the owner asked; it allowed spawning a reviewer and loading ADB without `METHOD: ADB`. Factory `AGENTS.md` says Lead only directs, Code implements and auto-commits when the job is done, never spawn, and do not load ADB when `METHOD.md` is missing or `PLAIN`.
ROOT CAUSE: L-011 dropped an orchestra name “Lead” and took the session Lead with it. ADB restated git and activation instead of deferring to AGENTS.md.
PROPOSED CHANGE: Lead/Plan/Code/Review stay. ADB must not contradict AGENTS.md: Lead directs; never spawn; Code commits when the job is done; ADB loads only when `METHOD: ADB`; A/B/C includes scopes.
STATUS: ADOPTED — 2026-08-31.

---

## L-013 — A removed commit-gate skill is gone

DATE: 2026-08-31
PROJECT: ADB method
SYMPTOM: ADB still required a named review-before-commit skill PASS and treated it as the commit check. That skill no longer exists.
ROOT CAUSE: ADB copied a dead skill name from the factory instead of deferring git to AGENTS.md without naming a removed tool.
PROPOSED CHANGE: Do not name removed tools. `/adb-review` stays (independent product review). Git: Code commits when the job is done (AGENTS.md). CARRIED is not the PROVE 3-round cap.
STATUS: ADOPTED — 2026-08-31.

---

## L-014 — ADB restated the OS until the product rules were hard to see

DATE: 2026-08-31
PROJECT: ADB method
SYMPTOM: After aligning with factory `AGENTS.md`, SKILL.md and every slash command repeated Lead / spawn / git / extra process names. Agents had to wade through factory rules to reach DEFINE / BUILD / COMPLETION. No product rule was added; the same rules were said three times.
ROOT CAUSE: Alignment copied AGENTS.md into ADB instead of one inherit line plus the product method.
STATUS: ADOPTED — 2026-08-31.

---

## L-015 — Projects must carry a copy; nobody fetches the method repo

DATE: 2026-08-31
PROJECT: ADB method
SYMPTOM: After L-008, setup did not copy `SKILL.md`. Agents were told to follow the method repo. New and existing projects never fetched it, so they kept an old method or none.
ROOT CAUSE: One canonical file only works if every project can reach that file. These projects do not.
PROPOSED CHANGE: Setup copies `SKILL.md` to project `ADB.md`, stamps `METHOD-VERSION`, and installs slash commands as copies. Agents follow `ADB.md`. `--refresh` updates copy and commands. STALE if the copy differs and was not refreshed.
STATUS: ADOPTED — 2026-08-31.

---

## L-016 — Role names Lead / Plan / Code / Review were unclear

DATE: 2026-09-01
PROJECT: ADB method
SYMPTOM: Public clones could not tell who they were talking to. “Lead” sounded like an orchestra boss; “Plan / Code / Review” looked like verbs, not the three living workers. Agents still spawned one-shots or did all work in the chat.
ROOT CAUSE: The split was already in `AGENTS.md` (direct vs do). The names did not say that.
PROPOSED CHANGE: Same four roles, clearer names: **MainAgent** (talks to the owner, most work handed off), **PlanAgent**, **CodeAgent**, **ReviewAgent**. Still never spawn. One-shot Tasks are not those three. If this session already is the living worker, or none exists to turn on, this session does the job and names the role.
STATUS: ADOPTED — 2026-09-01.

---

## L-017 — CodeAgent is a subagent, not an owner chat

DATE: 2026-09-01
PROJECT: ADB method
SYMPTOM: After L-016 the rules still talked about PlanAgent/CodeAgent/ReviewAgent **tabs**. The owner does not have those chats. CodeAgent is a subagent MainAgent starts. The “open the other card / one session” exception made the method unreadable.
ROOT CAUSE: “Living named agent” was copied from an orchestra of owner-facing chats. This method has one owner chat: MainAgent.
PROPOSED CHANGE: Owner talks only to MainAgent. PlanAgent, CodeAgent, ReviewAgent are named subagents for a job. No extra worker types. If the harness cannot start a subagent, MainAgent does the job in this chat and names the role.
STATUS: ADOPTED — 2026-09-01.

---

## L-018 — Forced subagents on every Plain job wasted context

DATE: 2026-09-01
PROJECT: ADB method
SYMPTOM: After L-017, MainAgent was told to start CodeAgent for most work. Small Plain jobs split context for no gain. The owner asked whether subagents only help from scratch; the real split is ADB / Heavy vs Plain.
ROOT CAUSE: “Most work goes to subagents” treated a one-shot worker as always cheaper than the owner chat. For a small change it is slower and forgets the thread.
PROPOSED CHANGE: Require named subagents only when `METHOD: ADB` or the job is Heavy. PLAIN and not Heavy: MainAgent does the work in this chat and names the role. Harness cannot start a required subagent → same chat, name the role.
STATUS: ADOPTED — 2026-09-01.

---

## L-019 — Owner wants chips, not A/B/C

DATE: 2026-09-01
PROJECT: ADB method
SYMPTOM: Start and Decision Questions asked A/B/C. The owner does not want to type letters. They asked for chips.
ROOT CAUSE: L-007 rejected chips because long label text was worse than a letter. That banned the click UI instead of banning only long labels.
PROPOSED CHANGE: Short chips (1–4 words), last = decide-for-me. Native picker when the harness has one (Cursor `AskQuestion`). No letters in the prompt. Typed A/B/C still maps. Long chip sentences stay forbidden.
STATUS: ADOPTED — 2026-09-01. SUPERSEDED in part by L-022 (A/B/C when chips are not clickable). `FEATURE-decision-options.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `START.md`.

---

## L-020 — Do not name other product methods

DATE: 2026-09-01
PROJECT: ADB method
SYMPTOM: Reading copies and agent files named methods that are not this one, including that they were gone. The owner was confused about what we mean.
ROOT CAUSE: Contrast against a former name teaches that name.
PROPOSED CHANGE: Write only PLAIN and ADB. Do not mention other product methods, and do not say they used to exist.
STATUS: ADOPTED — 2026-09-01.

---

## L-021 — METHOD.md did not follow a PLAIN↔ADB switch

DATE: 2026-09-02
PROJECT: ADB method
SYMPTOM: Re-Start small↔large (or `risk=yes` forcing ADB) updated `OWNER.md` / `LESEN.html` and could install or skip `ADB.md`, while `METHOD.md` stayed on the old line. `--plain` left `ADB.md` and `/adb` commands in place. Agents then loaded the wrong method, or none.
ROOT CAUSE: Setup refused to overwrite `METHOD.md` when it already said PLAIN or ADB, so Start could not switch. Cleanup on PLAIN was never implemented. Honoring flags on every setup call then let `--refresh` invent a switch and desync `OWNER.md` / `LESEN.html`.
PROPOSED CHANGE: Start is the switch (`--switch`). Setup writes `METHOD.md` from flags only on first layout or `--switch`. `--plain` then removes `ADB.md` and `/adb` commands; product `adb/` stays. `--refresh` without Start does not flip. `check-factory.sh` proves PLAIN, `risk=yes`, both Start flips, and that setup/refresh without Start keep the existing method.
STATUS: ADOPTED — 2026-09-02.

---

## L-022 — A/B/C when chips are not clickable

DATE: 2026-09-03
PROJECT: ADB method
SYMPTOM: Short chip labels in backticks (or a missing native picker) are not clickable in every harness. The owner could not reliably answer Start and Decision Questions without inventing a format.
ROOT CAUSE: L-019 banned letters in the prompt so agents never showed A/B/C when `AskQuestion` was absent. Backtick rows do not equal a click UI.
PROPOSED CHANGE: Chips when the harness has a native clickable picker; otherwise lettered A/B/C with the same short labels. Never both at once. Click, label, or letter all count.
STATUS: ADOPTED — 2026-09-03. `AGENTS.md` Talk, Start skill, `FEATURE-decision-options.md`, LESEN templates.
